- The future is now.
  - Human expertise remains crucial for direction-setting, effective planning, and divide-and-conquer between humans and AI.
  - Success requires understanding both the overall vision and specific details. Human craftsmanship will not become obsolete.
- The human (You) drives the project, not the AI, which means:
  - Be very clear and precise with your instructions. 
  - Break a large task into smaller prompts.
  - Look at the output with a critical eye.
- Prompt engineering is an art: like human conversation, effective AI communication demands practice, patience, and continuous refinement.
